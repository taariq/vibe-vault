# THE PALOMA  AI LIGHT NODE

To launch Paloma’s blockchain network into its new AI phase, Paloma announces the Paloma AI Light Node Sale with new Paloma AI applications and context storage.

# WHAT IS PALOMA?

Paloma AI is an artificial intelligence upgrade to the Paloma blockchain. Paloma AI unlocks the future of personalized AI, empowering users with their custom AI models, fine-tuned to their unique preferences and needs. Through Paloma's decentralized network, your personal context data is stored securely on Paloma’s LightNodes to power your AI applications. Paloma LightNodes consists of the Paloma client software, Paloma AI API functionality and local data storage. The Paloma LightNode now enables you to have a custom AI with your private data stored locally, on your computer, trained by the content on your computer or via your cloud accounts.

Imagine having an AI that truly knows you—capable of speaking in your voice, responding to real-time events, executing agents to complete actions in the real world, all powered by your own data. Paloma AI allows you to deploy AI agents and AI applications that work for you. Paloma gives you the power to harness advanced AI features without compromising control over your identity or security.

Purchase your LightNode

![](https://www.palomachain.com/assets/home/pigeons-fly-2.png)

## the problem:  We All Need  Our Own Custom AI

Custom AIs are essential for individuals who want AI models fine-tuned to their personal context. This contextual data includes information unique to you, such as your voice, preferences, and habits. To be truly effective, these AIs need real-time access to this data.

However, this raises critical challenges. Storing your personal context data requires global accessibility, privacy guarantees, and control over your identity. While availability is important, ensuring that your most intimate data remains secure and private is even more crucial.

The best AI services are those tailored to users’ preferences and needs. AI applications can achieve this, only if they have the necessary data. Unfortunately, no blockchain currently offers the infrastructure needed to make custom AIs accessible and privacy-protected. Existing blockchains aren’t designed to handle the personal context data required for AI-powered Web3 applications.Purchase your LightNode

## Paloma: Solving the AI and Blockchain Integration Challenge

Paloma tackles the challenge of securely integrating AI with blockchain through its innovative LightNode technology. Paloma AI LightNodes are Paloma clients that do not process state, but store off-chain context data that can be utilized by localized applications alongside on-chain LLM API endpoints. Paloma LightNodes aim to enable access to AI models supplied by Paloma’s API layer, but with data services stored locally on the node.

With Paloma AI, developers can deploy AI-powered Web2.0 and Web3.0 applications that leverage personal user context while ensuring privacy. This approach enables custom AIs to execute blockchain transactions or generate outputs that can be used both on-chain and off-chain. AI agents, which are conditional LLM flows and functions which are stored on Paloma. This allows Paloma smart contracts to host prompts that can be read by LLMs and then execute transactions on any other target smart-contract.

Paloma validators enhance security by managing on-chain transactions for AIs interacting with target blockchains.Purchase your LightNode

## the validator and light-node active set

Paloma validators, also known as pigeons, validate and secure blockchain state. Paloma AI LightNodes manage delegation of stake across all validators to ensure blockchain interopability across all Paloma target chains. Validators on Paloma must all support each target chain voted into governance, ensuring that there is infrastructure to deliver computing middleware services on all target blockchains. Web2.0 developers have an expectation of performance that Paloma has abstracted away as a concern.

Paloma AI LightNodes locally store context window data. When a LightNode user wishes to use their Paloma LightNode CustomAI application, the LightNodes access Paloma's API infrastructure to access decentralized LLM APIs provisioned on the Paloma network.

If Paloma validators and Lightnodes do not meet interoperability and security performance requirements, they are either jailed or their stake un-bonded. This aims to allow Paloma to become a trusted and reliable developer platform for Web2.0 developers that demand performance guarantees.Purchase your LightNode

## the fastest  blockchain computing middleware

Paloma provides Blockchain AI Integration and cross-chain message automation that focuses on three main areas:

Fast, Automated Interoperability: Allowing any Web2.0 developer to deliver end-to-end software applications that work seamlessly against any target chain and between target chains with native automation response to state transitions.

Native AI & API Integrations: Paloma natively supports automated bots and AI responses to external data and events, enabling developers to create end-to-end AI applications that operate across chains without external intermediaries.

Proof of Stake Mining: Paloma AI LightNodes mine GRAIN to maintain Paloma's cross-chain messaging network integrity. Lightnodes maintain even stake delegation work to ensure validator power consistency and security.

“As the former CTO and VP of Engineering at Ignite, I led development and roll-out of many of the Cosmos technologies Paloma users on its Cosmos-SDK blockchain. I am passionate to help Paloma reach more developers that want to create and schedule smart contract execution across multiple chains. Paloma LightNodes will broaden the community of active stakers and it will encourage more validators to secure the network. Let’s fly!”
