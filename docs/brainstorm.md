I've got an idea I want to talk through with you. I'd like you to help me turn it into a fully formed design and spec (and eventually an implementation plan)
Check out the current state of the project in our working directory to understand where we're starting off, then ask me questions, one at a time, to help refine the idea. 
Ideally, the questions would be multiple choice, but open-ended questions are OK, too. Don't forget: only one question per message.
Once you believe you understand what we're doing, stop and describe the design to me, in sections of maybe 200-300 words at a time, asking after each section whether it looks right so far.
