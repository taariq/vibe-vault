# Omnipair

Omnipair is an immutable protocol that enables permissionless lending and margin trading without reliance on external oracles, governance, or asset whitelists. It introduces a Generalized Automated Market Maker that unifies liquidity for both swaps and lending within a single pool. This architecture maximizes capital efficiency and is purpose-built to support underserved long-tail assets.

- Omnipair Token ($OMFG): [omfgRBnxHsNJh6YeGbGAmWenNkenzsXyBXm3WDhmeta](https://explorer.solana.com/address/omfgRBnxHsNJh6YeGbGAmWenNkenzsXyBXm3WDhmeta)

With a $300k minimum target, the funds will support a full year of product design, development, and auditing.

The OMFG token powers decision-making through futarchy. Funds are protected by market-based governance — making this the unruggable ICO.

### Problem

Most avenues for leverage today, such as perpetual exchanges and lending protocols, are permissioned— meaning that teams or governance bodies must manually whitelist assets before users can trade them with leverage. This creates a significant bottleneck, particularly because crypto traders have consistently demonstrated strong interest in trading long-tail assets.

### Solution

Omnipair is powered by a [Generalized Automated Market Maker (GAMM)](https://docs.omnipair.fi/technical-breakdown/general-automated-market-maker), a primitive that combines constant-product AMM functionality with isolated lending logic. This allows a single pool to support both spot trading and margin borrowing without oracles or centralized risk config.

### Get Funded

### Get Funded

A founder with an idea creates a launch on MetaDAO. Anyone can contribute USDC to projects they believe in. Every project has a minimum amount of USDC required to be launched, and if it isn't met contributors can claim their USDC back.

### Go Live

### Go Live

If the launch is funded, 10,000,000 tokens are distributed proportionally among everyone who contributed USDC. 20% of the USDC and an additional 2,000,000 tokens are paired in a liquidity pool.

### Go Forth!

### Go Forth!

All USDC is locked in a futarchy-governed DAO treasury. Aside from the allowance, contributors must raise proposals to utilize the treasury. Proposals are decided through decision markets, where people bet on how proposals would affect the value of the project. Team allocations and any potential emissions are also decided in this way.
